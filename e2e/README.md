# City Bike App end-to-end tests

## Getting started

Requirements
* Node/npm. Developed on Node v18 so should work at least on that.

Running
* Install dependencies `npm ci`
* Run tests with `npm run test:e2e` or open the Cypress GUI with `cy:open`

## NPM commands

* `test:e2e` Run in headless mode, for example, in pipelines
* `cy:open` Shorthand for opening the Cypress GUI
